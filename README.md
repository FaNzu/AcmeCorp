# AcmeCorp
AcmeCorp store with a draw/lottery

When the blazor project is turned on, checkout the different pages in on the website. Or test out the swagger interface for the api. 

The project includes:

- 2x class libaries
	+ One for model classes
	+ One is for the serialnumber generator and validator
- 1 asp.net core api
	+ for handling api calls and database context
- 1 asp.net core blazor project
	+ for the website and viewing the data
- 1 msunit test project
	+ for testing the serialnumber validator
	
When running the project for the first time, itll generate the serial numbers and save them in the database. And a copy in AcmeCorp.Web.Api/Data in a txt file to easily test and debug. Itll also save some products in the data base. To see see what is generated check out AcmeCorp.Web.Api/Data/AcmeCorpApiSeeder.cs


## Idea for the project
I found the company from the Road Runner series, and thought they would make a good subject for a new test website. 
The site needed to be able to send a serial number to enter a draw. Which i took some inspiration from the taiwan lottery system, where reciepts have a "Lottery Number".

### Step 3: Checkout the Serial Numbers

look at `serialnumbers.txt` file in the `AcmeCorp.Web.Api/Data` folder. This file should contain the initial serial numbers for the draw.
